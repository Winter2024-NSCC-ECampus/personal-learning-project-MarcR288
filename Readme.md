# Milestone 3 - 3D Rat Player
Overview
This project is built using Godot and features a 3D rat player with basic movement mechanics, including jump functionality, idle and moving animations, and collision detection. A simple 3D level is included to test and demonstrate the rat's movement and interactions with the environment.

Features
3D Rat Player: A fully animated 3D rat character capable of moving and interacting with the environment.
Animations: The rat has:
Idle animation (when stationary)
Moving animation (while in motion)
Jumping animation (when jumping)
Collision Detection: The rat interacts with the environment, detecting collisions with obstacles and the ground.
Basic 3D Level: A simple 3D environment designed to test movement and collision behavior.
Controls
W, A, S, D: Move the rat in the respective direction (forward, left, backward, right).
Spacebar: Make the rat jump.
